Here's what I can do:\n\n## Query & Analyze Benchmark Data\n- Show recent benchmark tests and their performance metrics (QPS, latency, error rates)\n- Filter and compare tests by database type (PostgreSQL, Snowflake Interactive, Hybrid, Standard, Iceberg tables)\n- Find top-performing configurations or identify bottlenecks\n- Analyze operation breakdowns and error patterns for specific test runs\n- Generate visualizations (charts and tables) to make performance trends clear\n\n## Statistical Analysis\n- Determine if performance differences between tests are statistically significant\n- Provide confidence intervals and trend analysis\n- Compare individual tests against rolling baselines\n- Perform Mann-Whitney U tests for query-level significance testing\n\n## Cost Analysis\n- Calculate credit consumption and cost metrics for tests\n- Compute cost per query and queries per credit\n- Compare cost efficiency between different warehouse configurations\n- Perform cost-benefit analysis across test scenarios\n\n## Key Features\n- **Automatic visualization**: I'll create charts for comparative data (performance trends, rankings, breakdowns)\n- **Statistical rigor**: When comparing tests, I always check for statistical significance\n- **Comprehensive metrics**: I analyze QPS (throughput), P50/P95/P99 latency, error rates, and capacity metrics\n\nJust ask questions about your benchmark data - I'll automatically select the right tools and provide data-driven insights with proper statistical context and visualizations.\n",
